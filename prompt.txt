Translate these Korean subtitles to english.

- Context: Behind the scenes of the recent fromis_9 album "Like You Better". fromis_9 is made of 5 members, Lee Chaeyoung, Park Jiwon, Song Hayoung, Baek Jiheon and Lee Nagyung. Non of the ex-members (Jisun, Saerom, Gyuri, Seoyeon) will be mentioned in this video!

- Keep each line brief and easy to read, like how real subtitles appear

- Make sure to use the same format as provided:

```
LINE NUM
TRANSLATION

LINE NUM
TRANSLATION

cont.
```

- When translating 1. Do not put ending full stops 2. Strip out korean characters used for emotions such as ㅋㅋㅋㅋ or ㅠㅠ from the translation

- Do not delete merge or skip lines

- There are sometimes names at the start of the lines or on the 1st new line. You need to convert the names into the format NAME: LINE.
Convert the names to short form like so:
```

HAYOUNG = HY
NAGYUNG = NG
CHAEYOUNG = CY
JIHEON = JH
JIWON = JW
```
For example:
"CHAEYOUNG 피디님! 제가 먼저 한 것 같은데요?"
"CY: The translated line"
